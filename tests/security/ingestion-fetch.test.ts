/**
 * What ingestion is allowed to fetch. architecture.md 15.1.
 *
 * A platform library's location is typed by an operator and then followed --
 * through redirects, through links in an `llms.txt`, through a crawl. Every one
 * of those is a URL our server requests on someone else's say-so, which makes
 * this the classic server-side request forgery surface: the interesting target
 * is not the open internet but the metadata endpoint and the private network
 * the app itself sits in.
 *
 * `assertFetchable` is the literal-address half of the defence and the half a
 * test can hold still. It cannot stop a public hostname that resolves to a
 * private address -- that needs resolution-time pinning the platform's `fetch`
 * does not expose -- so the deployment restricts egress as well. This checks
 * that the half we own does not regress.
