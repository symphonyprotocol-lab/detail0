/**
 * Cheap gate in front of the dashboard, and the browser half of the sliding
 * session everywhere else.
 *
 * The gate only looks for the presence of a session cookie: it saves anonymous
 * visitors a render, nothing more. The real check -- session live, account
 * active, workspace resolved -- happens in the dashboard layout against the
 * primary database, because permission state must not be decided on a cookie's
 * word (architecture.md 5.2, 16).
 *
 * The console gets the same treatment against its own cookie, and the two
 * never cross: a product session cookie is not an admin one, so it does not
 * open `/admin` even here (requirement.md 3.2). The real console check lives in
 * `app/admin/(console)/layout.tsx`. Capturing the path here is also what lets
 * the sign-in send an administrator back where they were headed.

 * date while the row is still live. Same value, same attributes, new
 * `Expires`; the row stays the only authority on whether the session is
 * alive -- a cookie that outlives its row simply resolves to nothing.
 * Set-Cookie on every matched request is the price of not needing a response
