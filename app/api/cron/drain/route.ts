/**
 * The scheduled queue drain. architecture.md 8.4.
 *
 * Every build is kicked off right after the response that queued it
 * (`after(runOperation)` in the dashboard and console actions), so for those
 * this is the safety net: operations whose follow-up run died with the function,
 * retries of failed ones, and the upload sweep that runs at the end of each
 * drain. It is also the schedule: each call first queues a refresh for every
 * platform source whose policy says it is due (`scheduleDueRefreshes`).
 * Vercel Cron calls it with `Authorization: Bearer $CRON_SECRET`;
 * anything else is a 401, so the route cannot be used to make the platform
 * do work on demand.
