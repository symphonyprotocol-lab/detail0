/**
 * POST /api/playground -- the web playground's one exchange. architecture.md
 * 9.5 and 9.6: this is the server-side auto-routed entry -- the question goes
 * through the same resolve-library-id the MCP agent would call, the server
 * reads the top candidates and lets the confirmed ones answer together
 * (scatter-gather, retrieval/gather.ts), and the generation path does the
 * rest through the shared retrieval function. A BFF for the site, not part of
 * /v1: the stream it writes serves the transcript component and nothing else.
 *
 * The response is an AI SDK UI message stream, but it carries no model text
 * part: every claim arrives as a `data-claim` the server has already bound to
 * a chunk of this request (requirement.md 5.1 rule 5). Piping the model's own
 * text stream through would put unbindable prose on screen and then take it
 * back, which is the thing that rule forbids.
 *
 * One exchange is one question. No history is replayed to the model -- rule 4
 * confines it to the chunks this request retrieved, and a transcript in the
 * prompt is exactly the outside knowledge that rule excludes.
 *
 * Which model runs is the console's decision, never the caller's: the body has
 * no model field, so a visitor cannot spend the platform's budget on the most
 * expensive entry configured. What the caller's plan buys decides which
 * entries it is answered by (the console's `audience`).
 *
 * Anonymous is the normal case here and rides the fail-closed anonymous rate
 * limit; a signed-in visitor runs as their workspace, metered by its quota
 * and answered by its plan's models; a Bearer key works the same way, and is
 * held to the same scopes it would need on /v1 -- one exchange routes and
 * then reads context, so a key that may do neither must not do both here.
 * Either way the stream's first data part says where the caller stands
 * (rule 8).
 *
 * An optional `libraryId` pins the exchange to one public library -- the
 * detail page's fixed entry (requirement.md 5.1: 针对该库的固定查询入口，复用
 * 在线试用的同一实现). Routing is skipped, nothing else changes.
