/**
 * Who is claiming, for the REST claim routes.
 *
 * A claim belongs to a workspace, so both credentials the product issues are
 * accepted: an API key (the integration path) or the web session (so the
 * claim page's fetches and a signed-in browser get the same envelope). A
 * session-backed mutation is additionally same-origin checked; an API key
 * carries no cookie and needs no such guard.
 *
 * The GitHub method needs a user, not just a workspace, because its check is
 * against the account's own consent (7.3.2); an API key has none, so that
 * method's verification is only reachable from the web flow.
