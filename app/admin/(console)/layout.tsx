 * Console shell -- design source frame `oxEhj`.
 *
 * Dark rail on the left, a search-and-identity header above the work column,
 * and a fluid content column: chrome every console screen shares, so each page
 * renders only its own stack. The column keeps the design's rail-to-content
 * proportion rather than the marketing site's old 918px cap (now 1080px too) -- the console's tables
 * are wide, and the design source is drawn at three quarters of desktop scale.
 *
 * This is also the authorization boundary. The console is a separate authority
 * from the dashboard -- separate entrance, separate identity, mandatory
 * two-factor -- and a signed-in product user must not reach it
 * (requirement.md 3.2), so `requireAdmin` resolves an admin session and nothing
 * else, and fails closed.
