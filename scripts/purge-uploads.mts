/**
 * Deletes uploaded PDFs that no library ever claimed: objects under
 * `uploads/` older than a day and listed by no `pdf` source. The drain does
 * the same at the end of every run; this is for doing it by hand.
 *
 *   npm run uploads:purge
 *
 * Safe to run locally because the store is paired with the database: the `dev`
 * Neon branch goes with `recall0-blob-dev` (architecture.md 3.2), so what this
 * machine reads as "no library claims this object" is a statement about the
 * same environment it is deleting from.
 *
 * `.mts` for the same reason as the other scripts: the env has to be loaded
 * before anything reads DATABASE_URL or BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN.
