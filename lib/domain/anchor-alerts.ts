/**
 * What about anchoring is worth telling someone about, as a pure function.
 *
 * Deliberately short, and every condition here answers from state the chain and
 * the batch tables already hold -- nothing is compared against a configured
 * expectation. Anchoring is a side system that has to stay removable (proposal
 * 4.1); a rule that needs its own setting is a rule that can fall out of step
 * with the setting, and then the alert is about the configuration rather than
 * about the platform.
 *
 * What is not here is on the console as a number instead: how many times the
 * code object has been published to, how many transactions the signer has
 * sent. An operator who knows what to expect can see those at a glance, which
 * is the honest division of labour between software and judgement.
 *
 * Two disciplines, both from architecture.md 17.2:
 *
 * - the payload carries ids, counts and stable codes only. No leaf preimage, no
 *   key material, no library title -- an alert travels further than a console
 *   session and lands in more inboxes than a database does;
 * - severity is about what the condition means, not how loud it feels. An empty
 *   account is critical because anchoring has stopped; a low one is a warning
 *   because it has months of runway.
