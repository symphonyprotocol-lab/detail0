/**
 * Importing a GitHub repository into a workspace library: the rules, as pure
 * functions. No fetch, no Next.js, no driver.
 *
 * A workspace may only import repositories the signed-in person controls on
 * GitHub, and only those that are public and not forks. Two reasons, both
 * from requirement.md 7.3 and architecture.md 5.4: the library's owner is
 * decided by control of the source, and a fork or a stranger's repository
 * would let anyone publish -- and earn from -- documentation that is not
 * theirs. "Controls" means one of two things: the repository sits under the
 * person's own account (compared by GitHub account id, never the login
 * string: logins are renamed and reused, ids are not), or it sits under an
 * organisation where GitHub reports them as admin or maintainer -- the same
 * bar requirement.md 7.3 sets for a claim. Plain membership or push access
 * is not control: a contributor may not publish the organisation's docs.
