 * Proving control of a domain before a library is fetched from it: the

 * A website, llms.txt or OpenAPI library is built from whatever a host
 * serves, so whoever controls that host is the only person who may create
 * the library (requirement.md 7.3: the question is "do you control this
 * source", never "who are you"). The wizard therefore cannot submit such a
 * library until one challenge for the source's host has been met, by one of
 * the two methods requirement.md 7.3.2 gives a domain:
 *
 * - a TXT record at `_re0-challenge.<host>` whose value is the challenge;
 * - a file at `https://<host>/.well-known/re0-challenge/<token>` whose body
 *   is the token.
 *
 * The verification is spent at creation. It is not a standing credential
 * (requirement.md 7.3.2: "验证结果只在校验当次有效"): a verified challenge is
 * good for one library, on the host it named, within a short window.
