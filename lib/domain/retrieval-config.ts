/**
 * The knobs of retrieval, and the spans they may be turned within.
 * architecture.md 9.2, 9.3, 9.5, 9.6.
 *
 * These were constants inside the two retrieval use cases. They are settings
 * now because turning them is an operator's job, not a deploy: how wide each
 * recall leg is, how much the reranker sees, how long a public result is
 * cached, and how much of a model's window the playground spends on excerpts
 * all trade quality against cost, and the right trade changes with the corpus
 * and the provider. What does not change is the span each may occupy -- a
 * recall width of zero is a retrieval that returns nothing, and one of ten
 * thousand is the full scan 9.3 forbids -- so the bounds live here, as domain
 * rules, and both the console form and the use case hold to the same ones.
 *
 * Pure TypeScript, no imports -- domain layer rules apply.
