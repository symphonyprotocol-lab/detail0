 * Notion cannot be read anonymously, and requirement.md 7.3 says a Notion
 * library is "created from the person's own authorised connection; the
 * creator is the owner". So the wizard connects the person's Notion account
 * (a public integration, its own consent, like the GitHub one in github.ts),
 * lists the pages that account shared with the integration, and imports one
 * of them with that same grant -- at creation and at every refresh after.
 * The grant is the credential and the proof of ownership at once: the only
 * pages it can read are the ones the person chose to share.
