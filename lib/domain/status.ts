/**
 * The arithmetic behind the public status page. requirement.md 13.3: the
 * platform's own tables are the monitor, so every figure here is derived from
 * rows the product wrote while serving -- never a fixture, never an entry
 * someone typed. Pure, so the derivation is checked without a database.
 *
 * A component is a surface with its own failure signal:
 *
 * - `retrieval`: `request_log` -- every REST, MCP and playground retrieval
 *   leaves one row with a status code and a latency;
 * - `indexing`: `workflow_operation` -- builds and refreshes finish as
 *   `succeeded`, `skipped` or `failed`;
 * - `refresh`: the refresh schedule -- a timed source whose due time has
 *   passed by more than a day is a refresh the platform owes;
 * - `review`: the review queue -- a public submission waiting more than a
 *   day is a promise (requirement.md 5.2: 预计时间) not kept.
 *
 * An incident is a run of days on which a component's failure rate crossed
 * its threshold. It is derived every time the page renders and has no prose
 * of its own: what happened is exactly what the rows say happened.
