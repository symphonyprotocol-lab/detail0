 * name the owner typed carries no routing signal (the rove-beetle article
 * lives in a library called "昆虫大全"). Library-level discovery therefore
 * searches a content-derived profile, never the display name: the document
 * titles, a term table extracted from the chunk bodies, and a handful of
 * centroid vectors that stand in for the library's topic clusters.
 *
 * Everything here is derived data (architecture.md 6.4): rebuildable from the
 * published version's content, written in the `profile` step of a build
 * (architecture.md 8.2), and never edited afterwards.
 *
 * Pure TypeScript, like the rest of the domain layer. The extraction is the
 * statistical baseline architecture.md 22 leaves open to revision -- what must
 * stay fixed is the shape: titles + terms + centroids, versioned by
 * PROFILE_VERSION so a smarter extractor rebuilds rather than mixes.
