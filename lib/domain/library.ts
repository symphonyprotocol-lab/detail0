 * the console four verbs over it -- create, refresh, suspend and publish -- and
 * nothing else. The distinction from a user library is not cosmetic:
 *
 * - it has no `owner_workspace_id`, and must never acquire one. Ownership is
 *   written only by a verified claim or an admin ruling (architecture.md 5.4),
 *   and a library the platform publishes has no claimant;
 * - it does not take part in revenue share (requirement.md 4.4), precisely
 *   because it has no owner to pay;
 * - it skips public review. The review queue exists to decide whether a
 *   stranger's library may be public (architecture.md 8.2, `Evaluating -->
 *   Publishing: private or platform library`), which is not a question about
 *   our own, so its lifecycle never passes through `submitted` or `reviewing`.
 *
 * Everything here decides whether a proposed change is allowed at all, so the
 * console, the tests and any future admin API answer the same way.

 * Two writers reach `source.config.folders` and its neighbours, and they must

 *
 * requirement.md 7.2 makes `re0.json` the *source's own* declaration of its
 * scope, and every build stamps what the file declared back onto the row
 * (`buildVersion`) so the library page can show the scope the index obeyed.
 * The dashboard's parse scope (`updateParseScope`) is the *owner's override*
 * of that declaration, and the override wins: a scope the owner saved is
 * never replaced by a build.
 *
 * The stored keys alone cannot tell the two apart -- `folders: ['docs']` looks
 * the same whichever writer put it there -- so the owner's save records
 * `ownerScoped`. Without that marker a source with no `re0.json` (whose web
 * and markdown connectors declare an empty config) wrote `[]` over the saved
 * scope on the very next build, and the build after that indexed everything.
 *
 * `ownerScoped` is written only here. `parseSourceConfig` keeps only the keys
 * it knows, so no repository's own file can set it.
