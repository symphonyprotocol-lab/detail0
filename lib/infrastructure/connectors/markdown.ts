/**
 * Uploaded Markdown and MDX files, read back from object storage.
 *
 * The PDF connector's shape (`pdf.ts`) with the extraction taken out: the
 * wizard put the files in the bucket before the library existed, the source
 * row's config says where, and each is handed to the pipeline as the text it
 * already is, named as the operator named it -- the `.md` / `.mdx` extension
 * is what tells the parse step the format (`documentFormat`), so the name
 * is kept whole.
 *
 * Bytes are decoded as UTF-8. A file that is not valid UTF-8 is still
 * decoded, with replacement characters, rather than refused: an operator's
 * one mis-encoded README should not fail the build of the other forty.
