/**
 * Uploaded PDFs, read back from object storage and turned into text.
 *
 * The other connectors fetch from somewhere; this one has nothing to fetch.
 * The wizard put the files in the bucket before the library existed
 * (architecture.md 7), and the source row's config says where. So the
 * "snapshot" is: read each key, extract its text, and hand the pipeline a
 * file per PDF -- named as the operator named it, so that a citation reads
 * `handbook.pdf` and not an object key.
 *
 * Text extraction is pdf.js, through unpdf's serverless build: no worker
 * thread, no canvas, no native module. Pages are joined with a blank line;
 * page boundaries are not headings, and pretending they are would cut
 * paragraphs mid-sentence at every page break.
 *
 * A PDF with no text layer -- a scan -- yields nothing that way. When an OCR
 * provider is configured (`ocr.ts`) and at most half of the pages carried
 * text, the whole file goes to the provider and its reading is used
 * instead. Whole file rather than the blank pages alone, because a scanned
 * report with a typed cover sheet reads as one document, not as a cover
 * sheet followed by an OCR transcript that starts on page two.
