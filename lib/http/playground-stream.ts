/**
 * The shape of the playground's UI message stream, shared by the route that
 * writes it and the transcript that reads it.
 *
 * A BFF contract, deliberately not in `contracts/`: architecture.md 9.5 keeps
 * generation out of /v1, and only this one page consumes these parts.
 *
 * There is no text part in the union, and that is the point. Model prose never
 * reaches the client as prose -- it arrives as `claim` parts the server has
 * already bound to a chunk of the same request (requirement.md 5.1 rule 5), so
 * nothing can be rendered as fact before it is citable.
