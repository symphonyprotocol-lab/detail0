/**
 * The worker side of the refresh queue.

 * unaware of each other: architecture.md 8.4 says a caller does not wait for a
 * refresh to execute, so the console must stay correct whether this runs a
 * second later, an hour later or not at all.
 *
 * Claiming is a conditional update, not a read followed by a write. Several
 * workers may drain the same queue -- the cron entry and the background run
 * that follows an operator pressing the button, at minimum -- and a claim that
 * two of them can win is a library built twice.
