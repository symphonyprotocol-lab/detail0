/**
 * One build: a set of sources in, one indexed but unpublished Version out.
 *
 * Sources are compared one by one against the current version
 * (`library_version.source_digests`). A source whose fresh snapshot digests
 * the same as last time is *carried forward*: its documents and chunks --
 * vectors included -- are copied into the new version under new ids, and
 * nothing of it is parsed or embedded again. Only sources that changed go
 * through the pipeline. A refresh that names one source (`workflow_operation
 * .source_id`) does not even fetch the others. The version stays what it
 * always was, one immutable snapshot of the whole library; what changes is
 * how much of it was recomputed.
 *
 * This is architecture.md 8.2 steps 2 through 9 -- fetch, scan, discover,
 * normalize, cite, chunk, embed-index, profile, evaluate. Step 10 (review) does
 * not apply to a platform library (architecture.md 8.1 routes it straight to
 * publishing) and step 11 is `publish-version.ts`, deliberately separate: a version that is
 * built but not pointed at is a safe state, and one this module can leave
 * behind if publishing has to wait.
 *
 * The version is written as `processing` and only becomes `ready` once every
 * chunk of it is in the table. requirement.md 8.1 forbids switching
 * `current_version` before a version is completely ready, and the cheapest way
 * to keep that promise is for "ready" to be the last thing written.
