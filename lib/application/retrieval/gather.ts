/**
 * Scatter-gather over the routed candidates. architecture.md 9.6, layer 3.
 *
 * `query-docs` is one library by contract, and stays so: the cost model of
 * 9.1 is an exact scan of one pinned version, and a citation, a cache entry
 * and a metered call each name one version. Reading several libraries for
 * one question is therefore a layer above it -- this one -- and not a change
 * to it. The web entry uses this layer; an MCP agent does its own gathering
 * by calling `query-docs` again, which is the 9.6 split of "who decides".
 *
 * What it does with the candidates the router admitted:
 *
 * - retrieves from every one in parallel, each with the full token budget
 *   -- the per-library scan is cheap, and a fair share decided before
 *   retrieval would starve the library that turns out to hold the answer;
 * - keeps only the libraries whose own retrieval is *confirmed*
 *   (lib/domain/routing.ts): a router candidate is a library that may be
 *   about the question, and only its chunk distances say whether it is;
 * - merges the surviving chunks by score and trims to the budget once.
 *   Scores are reciprocal-rank sums with one constant, so the merge is in
 *   effect an interleave by rank -- each confirmed library's best passage
 *   comes before any library's second -- and a reranker, when on, scores
 *   every library's head on the same scale;
 * - meters one Call, on the routed top candidate. The other reads are
 *   unmetered (query-docs.ts `meter`): one exchange is one Call whatever the
 *   router found, and the top candidate is the library the single-library
 *   path would have charged and credited.
 *
 * A failure of the top candidate is the exchange's failure, as before. A
 * failure of any other candidate drops that library and keeps the exchange:
 * one suspended or racing library must not turn an answerable question into
 * a degraded card.
