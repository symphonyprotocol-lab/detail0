/**
 * Deleting a library: the first of the two halves architecture.md 8.4 draws.
 *
 * A delete is not one statement. The request makes the library unreachable
 * and returns; the Delete Workflow (`lib/application/ingestion/purge-library`)
 * then removes what it held. Splitting it this way is what lets the request
 * answer immediately whatever the size of the index, and what lets cleanup be
 * retried without the library ever becoming reachable again in between.
 *
 * What "unreachable" means, in one transaction on the row:
 *
 * - `deleted_at` is set. Every list and lookup of live libraries filters on
 *   it, so the library is gone from the dashboard, the console, the catalogue
 *   and the routing index in the same commit;
 * - the lifecycle goes to `archived` and the index to `deleting`, so anything
 *   that reads state rather than the tombstone -- `isQueryable`, the catalogue
 *   predicate, the build's own guard -- refuses it too;
 * - the publication pointer is withdrawn. A query pins `current_version_id`
 *   at its start (architecture.md 8.3), and a null pointer is how a request
 *   that arrives after this commit finds nothing to pin;
 * - its redirects and sources are removed, and its queued operations are
 *   cancelled, so no alias resolves to it and no refresh rebuilds it;
 * - one Delete Operation is queued for the workflow.
 *
 * The `library` row itself is never removed. `usage_event`, `earning_event`
 * and `settlement` are append-only facts that reference it, and a deleted
 * library's billing history is still history. The Library ID is released:
 * `library_public_id_uq` is partial over live rows, so the workspace that
 * deleted `/owner/repo` can add it again.
 *
 * This module is the mechanism. Who may delete what is decided by the two
 * callers: `deleteWorkspaceLibrary` below for a workspace's own library, and
 * `deletePlatformLibrary` in `lib/application/administration` for one the
 * platform publishes, which also records the operator's reason.
