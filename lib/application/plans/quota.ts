/**
 * Call quota. architecture.md 11.1.
 *
 * Reservation and usage event are billing facts: they live in one Postgres
 * transaction with the business data. Never move this counting into Redis.
 *
 * Deduction order is fixed: plan allowance first, then the addon balance.
 * The addon balance has no expiry and rolls across periods, so eligibility must
 * be decided by reading the balance, never by a validity window.
 *
 * Concurrency: architecture.md 11.1 forbids "SELECT the remainder, then plain
 * INSERT". Two things make this correct instead: the workspace row is locked
 * (`FOR UPDATE`) for the duration of the reservation *and* the commit
 * transaction, which serialises one workspace's counting, and `request_id` is
 * unique on both the reservation and the event, which makes a replay of the
 * same request a no-op rather than a second charge. Per-workspace
 * serialisation is the cost; it lasts three reads and one insert.
 *
 * The commit takes the same lock because it counts too: the daily
 * attributable cap is read and then inserted against, and under READ
 * COMMITTED concurrent commits would each read the same count and every one
 * of them would pass a cap they jointly exceed.
