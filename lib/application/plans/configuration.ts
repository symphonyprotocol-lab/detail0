/**
 * Use cases behind the console's subscription configuration screen: read the

 *
 * There is deliberately no update and no delete. A Plan Version is immutable
 * (architecture.md 6.1, requirement.md 4.3): a price or ceiling change is a new
 * row, existing subscriptions keep billing against the row they were sold, and
 * history is never rewritten. "Edit plan" on that screen means "supersede",
 * which is why the only mutation here is an insert.
 *
 * requirement.md 5.3 makes this a high-risk action: it takes a reason and
 * writes the operator, the target, the values before and after, the result, the
 * time and a summary of the network origin to the audit log.
