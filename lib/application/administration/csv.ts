/**
 * CSV for the console's export controls.

 * Two things this has to get right beyond joining commas:
 *
 * - quoting, so a library title containing a comma, a quote or a newline does
 *   not shift every column after it;
 * - formula injection. These files are opened in Excel and Sheets, which
 *   execute a cell beginning `=`, `+`, `-` or `@` as a formula, and much of
 *   what lands here -- names, emails, library titles, audit reasons -- is
 *   written by someone outside the company. A leading apostrophe makes the
 *   cell text, which is what it always was. OWASP calls this out by name.
