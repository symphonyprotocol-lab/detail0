/**
 * The playground is the only entry point that produces prose.
 * requirement.md 5.1, architecture.md 9.5.
 *
 * Hard rules enforced here:
 * 1. retrieval comes from the shared implementation, never a copy
 * 2. zero chunks means no model call at all
 * 3. chunks are passed as untrusted data, separated from the system prompt
 * 4. every factual claim must bind to a returned chunk; unbindable text is dropped
 * 5. model failure degrades to the chunk list, never an error page
 *
 * The answer streams, and rule 4 is what shapes how. A claim is released only
 * after `openCitedAnswer` has proved the sentence complete and this module has
 * bound its markers to chunks of this very request -- so unbindable prose is
 * never shown and then withdrawn, it is simply never sent. What the reader
 * sees appear one claim at a time is therefore the same set of claims the
 * non-streaming path would have returned at the end.
 *
 * The provider is configuration: the console's `llm_config` decides endpoint,
 * model, budgets, unit prices, declared abilities and reasoning effort, and its
 * assignment decides which entry answers trial callers and which a paid plan
 * buys; a request may still name an entry. The caller's audience -- what its
 * plan buys -- decides which entries it may be answered by. The entry is
 * resolved before retrieval,
 * because its context window is what sizes the retrieval budget -- a constant
 * there would either waste a large model's window or overflow a small one.
 * The environment holds only the credential. Every successful completion
 * appends one `llm_cost_event` -- token counts and cost, never the question or
 * the answer (9.5's cost metric). The retrieval call already metered one Call;
 * generation never meters a second.
