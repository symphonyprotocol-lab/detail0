/**
 * Use case: write what the Payment Provider reported into the console's mirror.
 *
 * This is steps 2 and 5 of architecture.md 11.3 -- record the verified event
 * once, project it onto the document it describes -- and nothing else. It does
 * not charge, refund, retry or reissue: re0 never moves money
 * (requirement.md 4.3), so the only thing this side of the boundary does with a
 * payment is find out about it.
 *
 * Nothing calls this yet, and that is not an oversight: the webhook Route
 * Handler is the caller, and it cannot be written until a provider is chosen --
 * `paymentAdapter().verifyWebhook` is still unimplemented, and a handler that
 * cannot verify a signature is a handler that must not exist. What can be
 * settled before that choice is what the mirror accepts and how it behaves
 * under retry and reordering, which is what this is.
 *
 * It also deliberately does not touch `subscription`. Mapping a provider's
 * subscription lifecycle onto ours (step 3) needs the provider's price
 * identifiers resolved to a Plan Version (step 4), and doing half of that here
 * -- flipping a status without re-resolving the version -- would leave a
 * workspace billing against a row nobody chose. That belongs with the webhook
 * handler and its adapter, which is where the provider is finally named.
