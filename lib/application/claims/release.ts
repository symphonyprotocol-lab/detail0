/**
 * Use case: an owner gives a library up. requirement.md 7.3.5.
 *
 * The library returns to having no owner and stops earning (7.3.6); the
 * verified claim that made this workspace the owner is closed as `revoked`
 * with the release named as the reason, so the record shows how ownership
 * ended rather than a claim that still says `verified` on an unowned library.
 *
 * Only a *claimed* library can be released. 7.3.5 describes abandoning
 * ownership as a claimed library returning to the unowned pool; a library
 * whose creator is its owner by construction -- an upload, an OpenAPI file, a
 * Notion connection -- never made that round trip and has no claim to give
 * up. Releasing one would strand it for good: `owner_workspace_id` is the
 * tenancy key for manage, rebuild, delete, detail and files, and
 * `claimMethodsFor` offers those source types no way back in, so the library
 * would stay public and live with nobody able to touch it. It would also drop
 * out of `countWorkspaceLibraries`, making release-then-create a way around
 * the plan's library limit.
