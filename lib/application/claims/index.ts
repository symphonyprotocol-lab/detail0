/**
 * Ownership claim. requirement.md 7.3, architecture.md 5.4.
 *
 * The question is not "who are you" but "do you control this source".
 * A key placed in re0.json grants nothing: a config file can be written by
 * forks, pull requests and mirrors, so write access is not control.
 *
 * library.ownerWorkspaceId has exactly two write paths: a verified claim, or an
 * admin ruling on a dispute. Ingestion, review and refresh never touch it.
 * Route Handlers, pages and server actions may only enter through this layer.
